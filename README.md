# The purpose of this project is to create a webpage displaying a portfolio of myself using HTML coding.

# This portfolio displays a picture of me, my Discord username, a link to my email, an introduction to me, goals I would like to achieve in this course, my hobbies, a fun fact of me, and a footer with a copyright. 

# This webpage is organized only with HTML5 semantic elements ("<header>", "<nav>", "<main>", "<section>", and "<footer>").
